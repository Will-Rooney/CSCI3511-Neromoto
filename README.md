# Hardware-Software Interface (CSCI 3511-001): Group 7 - Project "Neromoto"

Projected Goal: To use an accelerometer as wireless controlling device to drive a Cerebot32MX4 controlled robotic motor, with eventual control via android application. 

Cerebot MX4 Update: Source code uses Digilent's(digilentinc.com) "RSK Startup Design Cerebot32MX4" project to control the motors in conjunction with Microchip's (microchip.com) "USB CDC Basic Demo" project to enable USB serial communication to and from the MX4 board.
